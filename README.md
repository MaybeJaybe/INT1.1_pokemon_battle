Pokemon Battle Simulation

This project is a simpler version of the pokemon battle feature. I was motivated to start this project when working on the Web 1.0 custom calculator, because I really liked the idea and started to see a vision. I thought it might be similar in usefulness to the pokefusion website, where people can just mess around with battling and eventually be able to use any pokemon.
